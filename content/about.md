This site hosts information related to the HumanitaRian-useR-group. This group is open to Humanitarian Information Management officers. 

We also have a skype group @ [https://join.skype.com/qYBKC5q3wKp4](https://join.skype.com/qYBKC5q3wKp4).

The idea is to:

- organise regular webinars using different format: Suggestions: panel discussion, one long in-depth talk, a couple of shorter talks, open-mic "quickfire" talks.

- share and disseminate some interesting approaches.
